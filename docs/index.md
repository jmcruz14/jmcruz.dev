# Juan Carlos Cruz – Code Portfolio
##### Note: Develop the Portfolio into a fully functioning website

### Description
Attached are a sample of works and projects done from my class and my free time at home!

## [Project 1: Image Classifier for the MNIST Fashion Dataset](https://github.com/jmcruz14/jay-cruz-code-folio-2022/tree/main/image_classifier_project)
* Built a program that predicts the type of clothing shown on-screen as part of a requirement for a Data Science and Analytics course
* Employed the tensorflow python module to import the image and build the appropriate convolutional neural network for the project
* Additional modules were pandas, numpy, and matplotlib
* Utilized 8 neural network layers of 5 types (Conv2D, MaxPool2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout) for the model to be trained for 10 iterations with a stop function in case the value change for 2 iterations remained the same
* Sample of predicted results were printed out via a Python list

## [Project 2: Predictive Model for Spam and Legit Messages](https://github.com/jmcruz14/jay-cruz-code-folio-2022/tree/main/predictive_text_modelling)
* Built a predictive model that determines whether a message is a 'spam' message or a legitimate one for a Data Science and Analytics course
* Dataset employed contained a sample of 5,572 SMS texts to be parsed over by the model
* Employed pandas, numpy, and tensorflow to clean up the data and tokenize into entries which were fed into a constructed Neural Network
* Neural Network was trained for 15 epochs before being tested for accuracy over a sample data obtained from 5,572 SMS texts

## [Project 3: Route Optimization Program Using TSP Algorithm](https://github.com/jmcruz14/jay-cruz-code-folio-2022/tree/main/route_optimizer_capstone)
* For a capstone requirement, was tasked with developing a program which parses through ≤15 addresses via Dash Plotly in Python
* Stack consists of Dash (front-end visualization and back-end routing), Dash-Leaflet (map visualization), and API Stack consisting of Mapquest and Google keys

## [Project 4: Ramen Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/jmcruz14/jay-cruz-code-folio-2022/tree/main/PROJECT-4)
* Analyzed a sample dataset of Ramen reviews from all over the world for a Data Science and Analytics course
* Identified the frequency of countries with Top 10 Ramen products, the average rating of Ramen products according to style specialty, and the ratings distribution of Nissin Ramen products
* Utilized matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas modules for data visualization and cleaning
