# [Project 1: Data Science Salary Estimator](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj) 
* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
* Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark. 
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model. 
* Built a client facing API using flask 

### Description
This is my portfolio of code which contains the following work done from class and my free time:

**Project 1:

**Project 2: Journal Entry Frequency Visualization**
* Analyzed my own journal entry database containing data on over 350 entry titles, date and time of writing, and journal number written from 2014 to 2021
* Employed matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas to generate, sort, and visualize the data in question
* Utilized aggregated bar graphs arranged vertically according to the hour of writing and horizontally according to the minute of writing to visually determine what times of the day I'd write about my day
